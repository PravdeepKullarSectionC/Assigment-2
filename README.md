# Assigment-2

For this assignment I decided to go with a simple buisness website of a fake incorperation I made that deals with building websites for users. This website also works for smaller devices by adding a hamburger icon once the page gets too small, creating a sliding animation to reveal the navbar. when you hover over the navbar it also changes text to show what youre currently hovering over. There is also a learn more button that slightly changes colour and even has an action happen when you click on it
